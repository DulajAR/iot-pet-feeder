# iot-pet-feeder
IoT-based pet feeder using ESP8266, Arduino Uno, Servo Motors, and Firebase. Control feeding via a Flutter app, where pressing a button rotates the servo 90° to dispense food and releasing it resets it. Feeding history is stored in Firebase Firestore. Ideal for remote pet care! 🐶🐱🚀
